Future changes:
  Multiple guilds,
  Splitting messages after max character length,
  Limitting name length, or implementing a Client side nickname index. 
  Client app, to implement commands and username parsing simpler, (username / avatar cache) 

This was thrown together the day before I left for vacation, (at the time I was using only Discord to talk to my friends), and knew they could keep me company on my 9 hour drive, also severely limited data that I accidently blew through the first 2 days of the data cycle. 

Current commands: 

!dir returns a list of channels that you can talk into.
!c [channel number] to send a message to another channel.
